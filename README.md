### 🔎 Problem Statement
- As a rapidly growing company, AtliQ Hardware's reliance on scattered Excel sheets for analytics has led to inefficient decision-making, resulting in significant losses, particularly during its Latin American expansion. Meanwhile, competitors leveraging advanced data analytics have gained an edge, leaving AtliQ struggling to keep up with outdated methods. To improve transparency in data-driven decisions and stay competitive, AtliQ has launched a data analytics project to enhance decision-making and strategic growth.

--------------------------

### 🎯 Project Objective
- To develop an intuitive dashboard that delivers actionable insights for finance, sales, marketing, and supply chain teams, along with an executive and key performers view. This will enhance transparency, improve data accessibility, and empower stakeholders to make informed, data-driven decisions for strategic growth and efficiency.

------------------------

### 🛢 Data Overview
AtliQ Hardware has provided two SQL databases and three Excel files for analysis.

The three Excel files are:

- Operating Expenses
- Targets (available only for FY 2022)
- Market Share (limited to the Personal Computer division)

The two databases contain the following tables:

gdb041:

- Fact tables: fact_forecast_monthly, fact_sales_monthly
- Dimension tables: dim_customer, dim_market, dim_product
  
gdb056:

- Contains freight_cost, gross_price, manufacturing_cost, post_invoice_deductions, and pre_invoice_deductions
  
AtliQ’s fiscal year runs from September to August, and the dataset covers actual sales from **September 1, 2017**, to **December 31, 2021**.

NOTE: Since this is a bootcamp project, the data files cannot be shared.

---------------------------

### 🧹️ Data Cleaning & Transformation
Standardized & Trimmed Data:
- Removed leading and trailing spaces from text fields.
- Standardized naming conventions for consistency.

---------------------------

### Data Structuring & Optimization:
- Created a dim_date table for better time-based analysis.
- Append fact_sales_monthly and fact_forecast_monthly into a single table -> fact_actual_estimates, to simplify calculations.
- Added calculated fields in fact_actual_estimates using data from relevant tables 
- Disabled load for tables that were used to derive calculations in fact_actual_estimates to optimize performance and reduce the Power BI report size.
